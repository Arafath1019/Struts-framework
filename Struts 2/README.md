### Why MVC?
* Controller is separated from model
* View is separated from model
* View is separated from Controller

### MVC Frameworks
* Different MVC frameworks have different implementations of these concepts
* They provide prebuilt classes
* They are extensible
* Popular Java Web MVC Frameworks: Struts, Struts 2, Spring MVC, Play, JSF, Wicket and many more.

### Framework Vs Pattern
* Pattern is the way you can architect your application
* Framework provides foundation classes and libraries
* Gets us started quickly
* Leverages industry best practices

### Main Components of the struts 2 MVC Framework
* Action Class
* JSP
* Struts 2 XML

### Struts 2 XML
* Controls the execution flow of requests
* Input: URL
* Needs to map to:
    * Action Classes
    * JSPs
* URL to Action Class
For Examples:
    URL: http://mywebapp/getTutorial
    Action Class: TutorialAction

    URL: http://mywebapp/getBooks
    Action Class: BookAction

    URL: http://mywebapp/getSeminars
    Action Class: SeminarAction

### Which Method?
* Default method of Action class is execute()
* Other methods can be configured

### Which JSP?
* JSP displayed depends on the result of the method execution
* Same action class may need to show different JSPs
* Action class result 'code' to JSP: 
    * Code: Success, JSP: success.jsp
    * Code: Failure, JSP: error.jsp
    * Code: NoSession, JSP: login.jsp
